# G5 Authentication Client #

A client library for the g5-authentication service.

## Installation ##

You will need the g5 private gem server at gemfury as a gem source.

In Gemfile:

    gem 'g5_authentication_client'

Just rubygems:

    gem install g5_authentication_client

## Configuration ##

### Environment variables ###

You can set the default value for several configuration settings via
environment variable:

* `G5_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` - the OAuth 2.0 application ID from the auth server
* `G5_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - the OAuth 2.0 application secret from the auth server
* `G5_AUTH_REDIRECT_URI` - the OAuth 2.0 redirect URI registered with the auth server
* `G5_AUTH_ENDPOINT` - the endpoint URL for the G5 auth server

### Module-level config ###

Any settings that are configured on the `G5AuthenticationClient` module will
apply to all instances of `G5AuthenticationClient::Client`, unless that setting
is overridden at the client level.

```ruby
G5AuthenticationClient.configure do |config|
  config.client_id = 'blah'
  config.client_secret = 'blah'
  config.redirect_uri = 'blah'
  config.endpoint = 'blah'
  config.debug = true
  config.logger = Rails.logger

  # It would be unusual to configure non-client credentials at the module
  # level, but it is possible. You would only need to configure one of the
  # following:

  # If you already have an OAuth access token
  config.access_token = 'blah'

  # For the OAuth authorization code grant type
  config.authorization_code = 'blah'

  # For the resource owner password credentials grant type
  config.username = 'blah'
  config.password = 'blah'
end
```

### Client-level config ###

To override a setting for a particular instance of `G5AuthenticationClient::Client`
without affecting any other instances, you can pass the configuration option
into the initializer:

```ruby
G5AuthenticationClient.configure do |config|
  config.endpoint = 'https://dev-auth.g5search.com'
end

client = G5AuthenticationClient::Client.new(endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000')
client.endpoint
# => "http://localhost:3000"

client = G5AuthenticationClient::Client.new
client.endpoint
# => "https://dev-auth.g5search.com"
```

## Examples ##

Assuming you have an account on g5-authentication already. Register your client
application and gather the client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, and generate
an authorization code.

    G5AuthenticationClient.configure do |config|
      config.client_id = "blah"
      config.client_secret = "blah"
      config.redirect_uri = "blah"
      config.endpoint = "blah"
      config.authorization_code = "blah"
    end

    client=G5AuthenticationClient::Client.new

    user=client.create_user({email: 'foo@bar.com', password: 'yadayada'})

    user.email="something@else.com"
    client.update_user user.to_hash

    client.get_user user.id

    client.delete_user user.id
